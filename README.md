# Telegram-movie-bot-python
A bot in Telegram that shows info about movies.

First, one must get an API Token from BotFather in Telegram. 
The user searches for 'BotFather', and then creates a Bot with: /newbot.
Afterwards, I did a command that lets the user enter a movie name, and then
if the movie exists in the website: http://www.omdbapi.com/, it takes the date from the site, arranges it,
and displays it including a poster. In order to use the website, the user must get a token for their API as well. 

There are many other stuff that one can do with a telegram's bot, which can be found with simple searches, like
